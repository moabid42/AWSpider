# AWS Honeypot Research Project

### Introduction

**AWSpider** is a research project that was initiated during my internship. It focuses on exploring the deployment of honeypots in the cloud using AWS resources. Honeypots play a crucial role in detecting and categorizing malicious traffic, contributing to threat intelligence, and enhancing an organization's overall cybersecurity defenses.
Project Goals.

The primary objectives of AWSpider are:

  **Cloud-Based Honeypots:** Investigate the feasibility of deploying honeypots on the AWS cloud platform.

  **Malicious Traffic Detection:** Develop effective honeypots capable of identifying and categorizing malicious network traffic.

  **Threat Intelligence:** Contribute to the generation of valuable threat intelligence data.

  **Cybersecurity Enhancement:** Enhance the cybersecurity posture of organizations by providing insights into potential threats.

### Future Plans

The project has ongoing plans that include:

  **S3 Decoys**: Adding S3 decoys to the honeypot network to bolster our capacity to identify and analyze potential threats.
